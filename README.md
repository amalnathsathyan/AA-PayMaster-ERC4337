# ERC4337 Account Abstraction Payamaster

This repository contains an implementation of ERC4337 Account Abstraction Payamaster.

## Introduction

ERC4337 is a new approach to solving the wallet user experience on Ethereum today. Account Abstraction acts as a "smart contracts wallet" where users can engage with the Ethereum network without possessing their own private keys or having to maintain Ether for transaction costs. The Paymaster is an ERC-4337 defined smart contract that handles the implementation of gas payment policies. These gas policies create flexibility for how gas is paid (e.g. in what currency) and by whom, which removes the prerequisite for users to hold native blockchain tokens to interact with the blockchain.
